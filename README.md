# Cookbook

### About Project
This project is a cookbook application implemented in Java using Swing for the graphical user interface within the scope of Bahcesehir University Data Structures and Algorithms II course. It allows users to manage recipes, search for recipes based on ingredients, sort recipes based on preparation time, view recipe details, add new recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes. A linked list is used for storing recipe ingredients and easily accessing them when needed, and a binary search tree is used for sorting recipes based on their preparation time.
